# Objects

Python has no unboxed or primitive types, no machine values. Instead, **everything in Python is an Object! **Objects involve an abstract way of thinking about programming. Down to the core, an object is just a struct; an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity. But on the surface, objects provide inheritance and other powerful uses.

* **Inheritance **simply means an object can be assigned to a variable or passed into a function for example. 
* Unlike C, where an integer \(for example\) is a machine primitive… a single unstructured chunk of memory… a Python integer will be an object, a large block of structured memory, where different parts of that structure are used internally to the interpreter.

# Lab 1A: Python Setup

Now that we learned the background behind Python, lets get to coding. Since Python is cross-platform, you can use whatever OS and text editor/IDE that you'd like. Below are my recommendations:

#### Recommended OS:

* Linux \(Fedora, Ubuntu, Arch, etc\)
* OS X
* Windows \(Windows is not my preferred OS for development at all. But Python works just fine on it\)

#### **Recommended editors: **

* Vim \(terminal based: steep learning curve\)
* Nano \(terminal based\)
* Sublime
* Visual Studio Code
* Atom
* Brackets

#### Recommend against:

* Visual Studio
* Eclipse
* PyCharm
* EMacs
* etc

We flat out do not need a full fledged IDE. Python is easy to understand and type. The faster you memorize it... the faster you'll be dropping scripts.
